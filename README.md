# CompilerProject
This is a compiler written with ANTLR4
in the src folder I have the frontend(Scanning/Parsing), intermideate(semantic analysis) and backend(code generator)
the .g4 file is our grammar, the .AKA files are test files written in our created language and the .j files are the object files generated by our compiler
